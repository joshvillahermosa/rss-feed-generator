RSS Feed Generator
===
Purpose of this repo is to serve a short term solution or potential project on creating RSS Feeds. This is merely a wrapper around [Dylangs Node RSS](https://github.com/dylang/node-rss). This also holds meta data for some of the feeds I host.

## TODO
- [ ] Fix RSS Feed Generation. The generated outcome does not match on S3!
